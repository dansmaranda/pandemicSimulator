# pandemicSimulator
Exploration of Monte Carlo simulation of spreading infectious disease. See list of objectives that this project is trying to achieve.

Objectives:
  - Implement  a Monte Carlo simulation that treats each individual as a probabilistic model with a certain chance and probability following a distribution to infect others and recover.
  - Treat this in conjuncture with implementing a transport network between meeting places in society.
  - Develop and implement statistics and data visualisation tools.

Progress:
  - Implement probabilistic model of contagion that looks at n nearest neighbours (✅)
  - Lay out framework for a transport graph network (✅)
